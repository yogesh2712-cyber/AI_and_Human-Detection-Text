Thus there will\\nbe three pairs of associations, and we denote them as SNPsAV45, SNPs-FDG and SNPs-VBM for the sake of description. For the three SCCA tasks, the proposed MTSCCA\\nlearns them together and generate a canonical weights\\nmatrix U for SNPs and one canonical weight vector vj for\\nAV45, FDG and VBM. We then calculate three canonical\\ncorrelation coefficients in terms of SNPs-AV45, SNPs-FDG\\nand SNPs-VBM separately. The two-view SCCA naturally\\nyields three CCCs for these three tasks. Though the mSCCA\\nonly learns one canonical weight vector for SNPs, we use\\nit three times to generate three CCCs with respect to the\\nthree tasks.\\nFig. 5 shows the CCCs of the SNPs data with each imaging QTs data, where CCCs estimated from SNPs-AV45,\\nSNPs-FDG and SNPs-VBM are separately shown. In this\\nfigure, both the training CCCs and testing CCCs, as well as\\ntheir standard deviations (SD) are presented. By changing\\nthe number of selected features (10; 20; ... ; 100 in this work)\\nfor both SNPs and imaging QTs, the CCCs can be generated\\nand then these curves are plotted. It is clear that the proposed MTSCCA obtains higher CCCs on both training and\\ntesting sets across all imaging modalities except for training\\nresults of SNPs-VBM. After investigation, this could be that\\nthe two-view SCCA runs into overfitting since it holds high\\ntraining CCCs and quite low CCCs simultaneously. We also\\nobserve that mSCCA always obtains the lowest CCCs on\\nboth training and testing sets across three tasks in this data.\\nThis is very interesting as it seems to violate the truth\\nbecause more data (three different imaging QTs here) ought\\nto provide more information. The reason might attribute to\\nits modelling strategy.

According  to  World  Health Organization  [2],  more  than  half  of  the  world population  lives  in  urban  areas.  It  is  estimated that  60%  of  the  world\\u2019s  population  will  live  in cities in the year2025 [3,4]. This entails a greater population  density  and  spatial  cover  which  has the  tendency  of  contributing  to  climate  change. These  two  of  the  most  serious  environmental issues  of  the  twentieth  century -population growth  and  climate  change -have  led  to increasing interest in the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon in recent years [1].Whilst the study of  UHI  has  come  a  long  way,  it  has  a  rather discouraging outlook as 75% of the publications related  to  UHI  failed  to  quantify  site  exposure and  land  cover[5,6,7].

Evidence for translational repression, mRNA destabilization and even activation of gene expression has been reported [22].\\nInitial work in animals pointed to regulation at the level of mRNA translation. Translation in mammals requires numerous factors that allow the recruitment of the ribosomal subunits to the mRNA initiation codon (initiation), the elongation of the nascent polypeptide chain (elongation) and the release of the mature protein (termination). Some of these factors recognize the 5' Cap or the 3' UTR tail of the mature mRNAs allowing its efficient translation [23]. Although most of the studies pointed to miRNAs as inhibitors of mRNA translation initiation [24,25], inhibition of elongation, premature termination of translation and co-translational protein degradation have also been described [22,26,27,28,29].\\nWhereas perfect pairing of an entire miRNA with its target resulting in endonucleolytic cleavage is a rare mechanism in animals, exonucleolytic degradation often occurs. Thus miRNAs promote the recruitment of deadenylation factors to the target mRNA which remove its poly(A) tail making the mRNA more susceptible to exonucleolytic degradation. Indeed, recent work shows that binding of some of these factors, such as CCR4-NOT promotes deadenylation to repress translational initiation [30,31].\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ChatGPT-Generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3607,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The concept of selection as a powerful algorithm for designing complex systems has been recognized since the early stages of evolutionary theory. Fisher introduced a geometrical model for optimization in multiple dimensions, which has found wide application in recent years [1]. Wright's metaphor of the \\\"adaptive landscape\\\" and the theory of a \\\"shifting balance\\\" further contributed to our understanding of how evolution avoids getting stuck at local optima [2]. Kimura estimated the information accumulation through selection, highlighting its role in evolutionary processes [3].\\n\\nIn the 1950s, digital computers were first employed to simulate evolving populations, paving the way for using simulations to solve computational problems [4]. This gave rise to various approaches in evolutionary computation, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and artificial life. Meanwhile, population geneticists also extensively utilized computer simulations. However, there has been limited interaction between these parallel developments [5].\\n\\nDespite the independent growth of these fields, there are shared aspects related to selection and adaptation. While evolutionary biology encompasses a broader range of topics, including tracing species history and understanding genetic variations, the role of natural selection in driving complex adaptation remains central to both evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation [6].\",\n          \"Human daily activities are governed by at least three distinct \\\"clocks.\\\" The most familiar is the Social Clock, which represents Local Time, or the standardized social time reference within a specific region or time zone. This clock facilitates synchronization with societal schedules, such as work, school, transportation, and retail hours. The Social Clock is intrinsically linked to the Sun Clock, which has been in existence since the Earth stabilized its rotational axis relative to the sun. The third clock, known as the circadian clock or Biological Clock, regulates a wide range of physiological processes, from metabolism to behavior, aligning our internal temporal organization with the daily environmental cycles [1].\\n\\nHistorically, the Earth's rotation has not always been consistent with the current 24-hour day. Approximately three billion years ago, when the earliest circadian rhythms evolved in single-celled ancestors of modern cyanobacteria, the Earth's day was less than 17 hours long [2]. Over geological time scales, the Earth's rotation has gradually slowed by approximately 2 milliseconds per century, allowing evolutionary adaptation of biological clocks to these incremental changes in day length. However, the rapid alterations to our Social Clock, driven by modern societal demands, far exceed the adaptive capacity of our biological systems [1][2].\",\n          \"The perennially ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) in Antarctica represent some of the most extreme lacustrine environments globally. Characterized by their endorheic and meromictic nature, these lakes endure extreme photoperiods, sustained cold temperatures, and near-total isolation due to perennial ice covers. Moreover, they harbor truncated, microbially-dominated food webs with minimal higher metazoan presence, fostering conditions conducive to the development of well-established microbial mat communities [1,2]. Consequently, microbial mats are prevalent and pivotal in the lakes of the MDV, playing a fundamental role in the lake-wide cycling of carbon and nutrients [5,6,7].\\n\\nDespite the recognition of benthic microbial communities as crucial components of MDV lake ecosystems, quantitative insights into their self-organization and growth remain sparse. This scarcity stems partly from the slow accumulation rates and the necessity for extended observational periods to fully comprehend community dynamics. However, in recent decades, the MDV lakes have witnessed gradual increases in lake levels, attributed to persistently warmer summer temperatures [8,9]. This rising water level presents a natural experiment to investigate the pace and patterns of microbial mat development on newly inundated soils and to understand the impacts of changing environmental conditions on established microbial mat communities as water levels continue to rise.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Mixed Text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3606,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Initially, the data for each harvested day is stored on a JSON file that has information regarding the tweet post.

According to the World Health Organization [2], more than half of the global population resides in urban areas, with projections indicating that by the year 2025, approximately 60% of the world's population will be urbanized [3,4].

However, this approach often leads to reduced germination rates [1]\\u2013[4]. Previous research has linked these diminished rates to the effects of the coating on water imbibition and the availability of oxygen within the seed [5], [6]. Conversely, hydro-absorber-coated barley, rye, and wheat seeds, when the coating constitutes over 75% of the average seed mass, have been observed to enhance seedling growth relative to those from uncoated seeds [4]. This improvement is attributed to increased efficiency in grain reserve mobilization, potentially due to a shift from invertase-based to sucrose synthase-based sucrose breakdown in the embryo [7]. We posit that this enzymatic shift could result from reduced oxygen availability to the embryo caused by the higher water saturation from the coating [7], [8].\\nIn general, germination progresses in three phases that are delineated by water uptake characteristics. Germination begins with rapid imbibition of water in phase I, followed by a plateau phase of seed moisture content in phase II, during which the enzymatic and energetic basis for reserve mobilization is laid [9,10,11]. Phase III begins with the radicle emergence and is characterized by a rapid increase in seedling water content and massive reserve mobilization from storage tissues. In an earlier study [7], we reported on early seedling growth and sucrose and glucose mobilization during phase III of germination. When growing from coated seeds, barley, rye, and wheat differed strongly in mobilization efficiency and thus, in the respiratory losses of reserves mobilized during germination as compared to seedlings growing from uncoated seed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Medical Research and Healthcare\",\n          \"Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence\",\n          \"Social Sciences and Humanities\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Unnamed: 4\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Unnamed: 5\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Unnamed: 6\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 275.6758307076695,\n        \"min\": 15.0,\n        \"max\": 1000.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It  is  estimated that  60%  of  the  world\\u2019s  population  will  live  in cities in the year2025 [3,4].

Evidence for translational repression, mRNA destabilization and even activation of gene expression has been reported [22].\\nInitial work in animals pointed to regulation at the level of mRNA translation. Translation in mammals requires numerous factors that allow the recruitment of the ribosomal subunits to the mRNA initiation codon (initiation), the elongation of the nascent polypeptide chain (elongation) and the release of the mature protein (termination). Some of these factors recognize the 5' Cap or the 3' UTR tail of the mature mRNAs allowing its efficient translation [23]. Although most of the studies pointed to miRNAs as inhibitors of mRNA translation initiation [24,25], inhibition of elongation, premature termination of translation and co-translational protein degradation have also been described [22,26,27,28,29].\\nWhereas perfect pairing of an entire miRNA with its target resulting in endonucleolytic cleavage is a rare mechanism in animals, exonucleolytic degradation often occurs. Thus miRNAs promote the recruitment of deadenylation factors to the target mRNA which remove its poly(A) tail making the mRNA more susceptible to exonucleolytic degradation. Indeed, recent work shows that binding of some of these factors, such as CCR4-NOT promotes deadenylation to repress translational initiation [30,31].\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ChatGPT-Generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3607,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The concept of selection as a powerful algorithm for designing complex systems has been recognized since the early stages of evolutionary theory. Fisher introduced a geometrical model for optimization in multiple dimensions, which has found wide application in recent years [1]. Wright's metaphor of the \\\"adaptive landscape\\\" and the theory of a \\\"shifting balance\\\" further contributed to our understanding of how evolution avoids getting stuck at local optima [2]. Kimura estimated the information accumulation through selection, highlighting its role in evolutionary processes [3].\\n\\nIn the 1950s, digital computers were first employed to simulate evolving populations, paving the way for using simulations to solve computational problems [4]. This gave rise to various approaches in evolutionary computation, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and artificial life. Meanwhile, population geneticists also extensively utilized computer simulations. However, there has been limited interaction between these parallel developments [5].\\n\\nDespite the independent growth of these fields, there are shared aspects related to selection and adaptation. While evolutionary biology encompasses a broader range of topics, including tracing species history and understanding genetic variations, the role of natural selection in driving complex adaptation remains central to both evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation [6].\",\n          \"Human daily activities are governed by at least three distinct \\\"clocks.\\\" The most familiar is the Social Clock, which represents Local Time, or the standardized social time reference within a specific region or time zone. This clock facilitates synchronization with societal schedules, such as work, school, transportation, and retail hours. The Social Clock is intrinsically linked to the Sun Clock, which has been in existence since the Earth stabilized its rotational axis relative to the sun. The third clock, known as the circadian clock or Biological Clock, regulates a wide range of physiological processes, from metabolism to behavior, aligning our internal temporal organization with the daily environmental cycles [1].\\n\\nHistorically, the Earth's rotation has not always been consistent with the current 24-hour day. Approximately three billion years ago, when the earliest circadian rhythms evolved in single-celled ancestors of modern cyanobacteria, the Earth's day was less than 17 hours long [2]. Over geological time scales, the Earth's rotation has gradually slowed by approximately 2 milliseconds per century, allowing evolutionary adaptation of biological clocks to these incremental changes in day length. However, the rapid alterations to our Social Clock, driven by modern societal demands, far exceed the adaptive capacity of our biological systems [1][2].\",\n          \"The perennially ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) in Antarctica represent some of the most extreme lacustrine environments globally. Characterized by their endorheic and meromictic nature, these lakes endure extreme photoperiods, sustained cold temperatures, and near-total isolation due to perennial ice covers. Moreover, they harbor truncated, microbially-dominated food webs with minimal higher metazoan presence, fostering conditions conducive to the development of well-established microbial mat communities [1,2]. Consequently, microbial mats are prevalent and pivotal in the lakes of the MDV, playing a fundamental role in the lake-wide cycling of carbon and nutrients [5,6,7].\\n\\nDespite the recognition of benthic microbial communities as crucial components of MDV lake ecosystems, quantitative insights into their self-organization and growth remain sparse. This scarcity stems partly from the slow accumulation rates and the necessity for extended observational periods to fully comprehend community dynamics. However, in recent decades, the MDV lakes have witnessed gradual increases in lake levels, attributed to persistently warmer summer temperatures [8,9]. This rising water level presents a natural experiment to investigate the pace and patterns of microbial mat development on newly inundated soils and to understand the impacts of changing environmental conditions on established microbial mat communities as water levels continue to rise.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Mixed Text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3606,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Initially, the data for each harvested day is stored on a JSON file that has information regarding the tweet post.

However, this approach often leads to reduced germination rates [1]\\u2013[4]. Previous research has linked these diminished rates to the effects of the coating on water imbibition and the availability of oxygen within the seed [5], [6]. Conversely, hydro-absorber-coated barley, rye, and wheat seeds, when the coating constitutes over 75% of the average seed mass, have been observed to enhance seedling growth relative to those from uncoated seeds [4]. This improvement is attributed to increased efficiency in grain reserve mobilization, potentially due to a shift from invertase-based to sucrose synthase-based sucrose breakdown in the embryo [7]. We posit that this enzymatic shift could result from reduced oxygen availability to the embryo caused by the higher water saturation from the coating [7], [8].\\nIn general, germination progresses in three phases that are delineated by water uptake characteristics. Germination begins with rapid imbibition of water in phase I, followed by a plateau phase of seed moisture content in phase II, during which the enzymatic and energetic basis for reserve mobilization is laid [9,10,11]. Phase III begins with the radicle emergence and is characterized by a rapid increase in seedling water content and massive reserve mobilization from storage tissues. In an earlier study [7], we reported on early seedling growth and sucrose and glucose mobilization during phase III of germination. When growing from coated seeds, barley, rye, and wheat differed strongly in mobilization efficiency and thus, in the respiratory losses of reserves mobilized during germination as compared to seedlings growing from uncoated seed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
